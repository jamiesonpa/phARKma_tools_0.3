IceCure is an Israeli medical device company known for developing a precision cryoablation probe for the treatment of benign or precancerous fibroadenomas in breast tissue.
Their treatment is highly effective, leaves no scar tissue, and is generally equivalent in terms of invasiveness to a core cut biopsy. Compared to traditional excision methods,
IceCure's cryoablation represents a cheaper, safer, and more effective option which has been gaining traction for several years now, not only in Israel but also in the united states.
IceCure significantly underperformed last year despite impressive topline and gross margin growth since 2018. Investors may be manifesting bearish sentiment in response to their
continued significantly negative posted annual operating income numbers. These expenses are almost entirely directed towards research and development, and this R&D is focused on expanding the
indications which their cryoablation probe can address-- and early data on the use of their probe for the treatment of renal carcinomas has shown positive early results in Israel. We expect
that, like many early stage pharmaceutical, diagnostic, and medical device companies, IceCure's long term earning potential and intellectual property is fundamentally undervalued by the market,
